# Timetable

This app is made for my degree. The subject was to creating a smart timetable for students to their smart phones. I created a web application what you see on this branch.

What would you know this app:

It is made only for smart phones, so there is no a good look like on table view, not responsive. Change the view in your browser to mobile device and there will be real look like of this app.

In the back-end I used PHP and MySQL for the database.

In the front-end I used JavaScript and Ajax for the communication of the webserver.

For the user interface I used templates and the w3.css from w3schools.

If you want to try it you will need a server for running the PHP code and the database. You can run the application with index.php file.
